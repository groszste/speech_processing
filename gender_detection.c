Purpose: This program identifies the gender of a speaker.

The code will parse a speech signal into multiple window samples
and perform processing on each individual window and output
either a 0,1,2. 0 indicates that the gender could not be identified,
a 1 indicates a male, and a 2 indicates a female.

The algorithm used requires a training period that provides a
normalization of the sampled speech signal.

The first five windows are used to calculate an offset (an average)
to be subtracted from the signal.

The next five windows are used to establish thresholds in identifying
certain characteristics of speech, such as signal energy (SE) and zero
crossing rate (ZCR). These thresholds are used to distinguish speech from noise
and voiced syllables from un-voiced syllables.

Voiced syllables are characterisitc of high signal energy and low zero
crossing rate. If a possible voiced signal is identified, the code
attempts to detect the period of that speech window. From the period,
the pitch (and thus the gender) of the speaker can be interpreted.

Common frequency cut-offs to distinguish male from female speakers
are the following:
male: 	101 Hz < freq < 175 Hz
female: 190 Hz < freq < 400 Hz
